Postmorterm
A postmortem is a comprehensive report created after a system failure or outage and it serves two main purposes:

1. Informing the Company:

Provides a detailed account of the cause of the outage.
Ensures that all employees, including managers and executives, understand what happened and how it impacts their work.
Learning and Improvement:

2. Identifies the root cause(s) of the outage.
   Implements measures to prevent the same issue from recurring.
   In essence, a postmortem is a critical tool in the tech industry for continuous improvement and accountability, ensuring that failures are thoroughly analyzed and addressed to prevent future occurrences.
